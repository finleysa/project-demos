        <mat-card-content>
            I'm a military Naval Aircrew veteran turned software nerd. I worked as a Tech Lead for Science Applications International Corporation. I transitioned out of my IT role and decided to move into software development by attending <a style="color: white;" rel="noopener" href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/">Nashville Software School (NSS)</a> in 2014. NSS was a great 6 month full-stack learning experience that has launched my career in the world of software. Since then Iâ€™ve worked in various software development roles here in the states, abroad, and for government agencies directly.
